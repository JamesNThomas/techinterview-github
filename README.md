# GitHub Events Feed
### Installation and Instructions
There are two ways to run the application. The first of which is to download the APK (included in the folder named "Android APK") and install it on an Android device, such as a tablet or phone. 

Additionally, one could opt to run it 'locally' in their browser of choice by navigating to /www/index.html. If you choose to open the html directly in the Chrome browser and would like to see how it would look on a given device, right click in the middle of the page and click "inspect element." Once in view, you can click the "Toggle Device" button to select your mobile device of choice.


### Features
- Touch friendly
- Pull down refresh
- Refresh button
- Mobile focused framework
- Feed of public events (30 most recent)
    - Each event includes the user avatar, username, event type, and repository name
        - Touch/Click expandable details include event ID, time, repository URL (clickable), repository ID, organization name, organization URL, organization ID, user URL, and user ID
- User Authentication
    - User feed of events (public and private)
        - If the user provides correct password information, both private and public events will display in their feed; otherwise only public events will display
- Clickable repository links
- Screen rotation
- Device specific CSS will be applied depending on the device accessing the webapp (Android or iOS), or for which device the code has been compiled for using PhoneGap.

### Future improvements
- Improved Security
    - With proper use of OAuth, this application could bypass the need for storing sensitive information in the form of string variables.

### Other Notes
To achieve optimal cross-platform integration between iOS and Android, I chose to write this application in HTML5. With access to the PhoneGap Build service, I was able to produce a smoothly working APK, and with proper authorization from Apple, the application could be just as easily compiled for use on iOS. Thanks to the Framework7 HTML5 framework, this application displays using the proper mobile elements specific to the given device.

# Technical Interview Homework: GitHub Dashboard
##Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to assess the candidateâ€™s ability to build cross platform software clients that satisfy stated requirements. The completed assignment should not only satisfy the requirements outlined below, but also give the candidate an opportunity to show-off their skills.

##Prerequisites
- Candidates must have a GitHub account

##Instructions
1. Fork this repository - [https://github.com/Praeses/techinterview-github](https://github.com/Praeses/techinterview-github)
2. Create a client that satisfies the requirements below
3. Include, at the top of this README, instructions required for the reviewer to run the submission
4. Include, at the top of this README, any other information that will be useful to the reviewer
5. Create a pull request prior to the due date to have your submission reviewed

Once the submission is reviewed the candidate will be notified and possibly invited to participate in a follow-up interview where interviewers will collaboratively work with the candidate to review the submission, discuss possible enhancements, and possibly implement a new feature. 

#####Additional Notes...

- Feel free to ask your point of contact any clarifying questions you might have. 
- Submissions must be relatively trivial to run as outlined in the candidate's instructions. We suggest that you test the run instructions on a clean clone of your repository. **Submissions we can't run per the instructions will be rejected.**
- Client technology for the submission is at the discretion of the candidate, Preferred platforms include the following...
	- **Xamarin** - Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio
	- **HTML/CSS/JS (touch friendly, tablet/phone targeted)**
	- **Native iOS** - Xcode 
	- **Native Android** - Android Studio
	- **Windows/Phone** - Visual Studio
- Third party libraries or packages are acceptable but must be managed via a package manager i.e. Nuget, CocoaPods, npm, bower, etc. Third party components will NOT be manually installed by the reviewer.

##Assessment

Cross platform client development requires a familiarity and aptitude to work with...

- Client platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, Web Browsers, etc.
- Presentation layer frameworks: Native iOS & Android, Cordova, HTML/CSS/JS, etc.
- HTTP based APIs

#####Assessment will focus on the candidate's ability to...

- Review and understand API documentation.
- Consume an API, and present API content in a client. 
- Write clear, understandable, and maintainable code. Please use the predominant coding style for whatever language the submission is written in.
- Create a simple and understandable user interface and user experience. Note that clear and understandable does NOT mean graphically interesting.
- The user experience should be targeted at a mobile screen size, preferably tablet optimized yet functional on a phone sized screen.

#####Exceptional Candidates will...

- Submit a solution that will run on both iOS and Android
- Have a simple architecture that is easy to enhance and extend

##Requirements - GitHub Dashboard 
GitHub has a public API that will be used for this assignment. We will be displaying content from the GitHub API in a user "dashboard."

#####Resources
- [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/ "GitHub API")

#####Minimum Requirements
- The client will have a title clearly indicating the purpose and content of the client.
- The client will be touch friendly.
- The client will display a feed of GitHub public events available at the following endpoint
	- Public Events url: [https://api.github.com/events](https://api.github.com/events)
	- Events Documentation: [https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/)
- Each public event displayed in the feed will display user friendly values for...
	- Username
	- Event Type
	- Repository to which the event applies
- The client will have a button to refresh the feed of public events.
- The client will allow a user to tap the public event and display event details.

#####Optional (stretch) Enhancements
- Implement a "pull down" to refresh the feed of public events.
- On the public event details screen...
	- Display a user's avatar next to their name.
	- Provide a link/button to display in the app or a separate browser window the GitHub repository's main web page.
- Authenticate a GitHub user
- Display the authenticated user's username and avatar in client-platform typical location
- Display a feed of the Events performed by the authenticated user
	- [https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-events-performed-by-a-user](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-events-performed-by-a-user)
- Support screen rotation
